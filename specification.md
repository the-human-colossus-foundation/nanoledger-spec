## Abstract

The need for having the evidence of changes is not a new concept. Any system that relies its trust basis on linkage to some other event or attestation, creates a chain of events. In one form or another, they constitute an evidence of changes that have happened. Any VCS, event sourced system, blockchain, or chained data containers requirement, they all have foundation in the simplest form of append-only-log that links `N-th - 1` event with `N-th` event.

In this paper we propose the Nanoledger, a pure form of a self-contained evidence of changes that are linked to each other by utilizing cryptograhpic one way hash functions.
